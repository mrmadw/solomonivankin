# 👋 Hi, I'm Solomon Ivankin

I'm a **full-stack developer** with a strong focus on building practical, secure, and scalable web applications. I work primarily with **React** on the frontend and **Django / Django REST Framework** on the backend, with an emphasis on clean architecture, responsive design, and real-world usability.

I recently completed an **Advanced Diploma in Information Technology** and I’m currently gaining hands-on experience as an **ICT Trainee**, while actively building and refining production-ready projects.

## 🚀 Current Project: Full‑Stack Web Platform (React + Django)

This repository represents an **actively developed full-stack web application** designed with modern web standards and scalability in mind. The project is approaching its **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** stage.

### 🧩 Project Overview

* **Frontend:** React 18, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios
* **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
* **Architecture:** Decoupled frontend & backend
* **Auth:** Token-based authentication
* **Status:** MVP nearing completion

The platform includes secure authentication, a responsive dashboard, backend APIs, and a modular layout system that works across mobile and desktop devices.

## 🔐 Security‑First Development Approach

While still in development, the project follows strong foundational security practices:

* Token-based authentication for protected routes
* Backend validation using DRF serializers
* Separation of frontend and backend responsibilities
* No sensitive logic or credentials exposed on the client
* Graceful handling of unauthorized access

Security hardening (rate limiting, permissions, logging) is planned as the project moves closer to production.
